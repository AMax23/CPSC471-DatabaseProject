# Daycare Management System

CPSC 471 project for the Data Base Management Systems course at the University of Calgary

## Overview
* This API was designed for a real-life problem for which a database application was appropriate
* This was created using PHP and a MySQL database system
* For a list of available endpoints, their methods, parameters, and other details, view the [API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13545898/TVmLDe7R)
* Refer to [FileStructure.txt](FileStructure.txt) for a quick overview of the project folder structure
* See the [final report](CPSC471_ProjectFinalReport.pdf) for a complete overview of the project

## Download and Install
* A web server
* MySQL database
* PHP
* API testing tool

## Quick Set Up
1. Download and place the project file inside the web folder (www) of the web server
1. Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and login
1. Change password to ``root``
1. Navigate to http://localhost/CPSC471-DatabaseProject/config/Install.php to setup the database and tables
1. Use the API testing tool to send API requests

## API Authentication
* The API endpoints are protected with ``Basic Auth``
* Each endpoint requires a valid username and password to make the request
* Refer to the [API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13545898/TVmLDe7R) for the clearance level required for each endpoint
* The valid accounts are:
    * Username: ``high``, Password: ``high``, Clearance Level: ``high``
    * Username: ``med``, Password: ``med``, Clearance Level: ``medium``
    * Username: ``low``, Password: ``low``, Clearance Level: ``low``

## Changing The Database Configuration
* [Install.php](config/Install.php) runs a SQL script to create the database, tables and the stored procedures
* The name of the database created with the script is called ``childDaycare``
* The configuration assumes that the username and password to phpMyAdmin is ``root``
* This configuration can be changed to your own preference by following these steps:
    1. Open [Database.php](config/Database.php) to change ``servername``, ``username``, or ``password``
    1. To change the database name, open [database.sql](config/database.sql) and change ``childDaycare`` in lines 1, 3 and 5
* Once those changes are made, navigate to http://localhost/CPSC471-DatabaseProject/config/Install.php
* Use the API testing tool to send API requests
